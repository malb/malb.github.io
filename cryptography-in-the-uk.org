#+setupfile: setup.org

The “Cryptography in the UK” mailing list, is the “main” cryptography research mailing list in the UK. People send seminars, calls for papers, job ads: https://groups.google.com/g/cryptography-in-the-uk

We do light gatekeeping at sign-up time to prevent spam, e.g. people peddling their currency.[fn::For the avoidance of doubt, if you work for a blockchain project and are interested in cryptographic research and you are very welcome to sign up. We just don’t want people to push their coins or products.] So let us know who you are when you sign up.
