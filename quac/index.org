That quantum computers are bad news for RSA and discrete logarithms gave rise to post-quantum cryptography, which is now under consideration for standardisation by NIST, ETSI, ISO and the IETF. A natural question, then, is how quantum computers fare against these post-quantum schemes. Here, so far, the main application is Grover’s algorithm for various exhaustive search steps within classical cryptanalytic algorithms.

This workshop will give an overview of the use of quantum algorithms in cryptanalysis beyond Grover to encourage the broader exploration of quantum algorithms for cryptanalysis. The program is comprised of invited talks from expert speakers who have worked in the development of quantum algorithms and their application in cryptanalysis. The goal is a summer-school-like format and we strongly encourage audience participation.
